- Db-First Project
- Generate Models by Scaffolding
- Seed User Data in Db First
- UoW (Unit of Work) + Repository Pattern
- Direct Use of UnitOfWork and Repositories in Controllers without using Services Layer (under Infrastructure Project)
	but AccountController use the Service layer (does not use UoW + Repository directly) and call AuthService that 
	encapsulates the business logic and interact with the repositories through the UnitOfWork.
- Can use entities as parmeters in API methods by excluding navigation properties in serialization and deserialization (Ref Vessel)

Dto (Data Transfer Object) is commonly used for classes that represent the data structure for transferring data
between different layers (like between the API and the client).
